The UPD Dorm Tracker is an Android app designed to assist dormers and dorm management in various dorm-related functions. Dormers will be able to make requests, file file reports and overnight passes, and track billings. Dorm management can track dormer requests and statistics, like the number of dormers who are currently in the dorm. Management can also post announcements and FAQs for the dormers. They can also scan IDs using RFID to register new dormers to the system.

# Dormers

When a dormer logs in, they are directed to the dashboard, with announcements and FAQs, as seen below:

The button in the upper right allows the user to check their profile or sign out. Clicking "Sign Out" signs out the user and directs them back to the log in page

Clicking in "Profile" allows the user to view their own information, as well as the requests that they have submitted. Clicking on "View" shows the details of the request.

Back to the Dashboard, clicking Request Pass, Request Bill, and File Report would allow the user to file the respective requests after filling in the relevant fields.
